**Frequently Asked Questions.** Bellow you can find the most frequent questions about Thin Wallet and its future.

**What about Passbook?** We have prepared new application for early adopters â€“ [Passhop](http://passhop.passauthority.com). Direct Passbook support in Thin Wallet is planned for users who purchased the unlimited version.

**How about making barcodes bigger to improve scanning?** We have run a lot of tests including full screen barcode display. Unfortunately the conclusion is that the physical barcode size has no effect on the reliability of scan.

**What's up with the Card Images?** Once set, the image on the card should help you distinguish card at a first glance. It is not intended for viewing the image later or storing any associated pictures. However this might be subject to change.
					
**Why there is no card sorting or search?** Because there is no time to search for your card while shopping! If you set Card Name (or Venue) to its Foursquare name you will always have it at hand at the right time (and place)! If you need to reorder your cards, just press edit on the main screen and drag and drop cards as desired.
